# ObjectOrientedDesignCSE687
Syracuse University
Covers design and implementation of object oriented programs using the C++ language. This is an intensive course covering: design strategies used in object oriented design, essentially all of the Standard C++ Programming Lanaguage, and its Standard Library. A typical class will introduce some part of the C++ language, present a design principle that relates in some way to that part, and illustrate both with code examples. Four design and implementation projects are required that are progressively more challenging. A lot of work outside of class is expected. Students that complete this course with good grades will have the skills to work in almost any commercial or industrial organization in this country.
